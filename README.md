### About the Project

#### This was a code quiz project for fullstack web development students to test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The project scope sought to provide a timed quiz web application which stores high scores enabling students to gauge their progress compared to their peers. The application was to have a clean and polished user interface rendering responsively across a variety of devices. 

#### Completion of the acceptance criteria implemented the following:
```
GIVEN a student is taking a code quiz
WHEN the student clicks the start button
THEN a timer starts and they are presented with a question
WHEN the student answers a question
THEN they are presented with another question
WHEN they answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN the student can save their initials and score
```
